# Discovery Log: First-Class Passes

Elaboration findings persisted during Phase 2.5 domain discovery.
Builders: read section headers for an overview, then dive into specific sections as needed.

## Codebase Context

**Stack:** Shell (hooks/lib), TypeScript (shared parser, CLI dashboard, MCP server), Next.js 15 (website)
**Architecture:** Monorepo with three components — plugin (Claude Code plugin), website (Next.js static site), paper (methodology spec). Plugin uses bash hooks and SKILL.md-based agent orchestration.
**Build tools:** Bun (lockfile present: `bun.lock`), Biome (linting/formatting), npm workspaces (`website`, `plugin/shared`, `plugin/mcp-server`, `plugin/cli`)
**Conventions:** YAML frontmatter in markdown files for metadata, bash hooks for lifecycle events, shell libraries in `plugin/lib/`, hat definitions as markdown in `plugin/hats/`, skills as `SKILL.md` files in `plugin/skills/{name}/`
**Concerns:** Hat resolution currently uses override semantics (project `.ai-dlc/hats/` replaces plugin `hats/`), needs to change to augmentation. No pass definition files exist yet (`plugin/passes/` directory missing). Pass types are hardcoded as an enum in settings schema.

## Codebase Pattern: Current Pass Implementation

Passes currently exist as a scheduling/metadata concept only -- they control which units execute in a given phase but do NOT influence how hats behave during construction. Here is a comprehensive map of every file that touches passes:

### Data Model (types.ts)
- `IntentFrontmatter.passes?: string[]` -- ordered pass array on the intent
- `IntentFrontmatter.active_pass?: string` -- currently active pass
- `UnitFrontmatter.pass?: string` -- which pass a unit belongs to

### Settings Schema (settings.schema.json)
- `default_passes` property: `type: "array"`, items: `enum: ["design", "product", "dev"]`
- **Problem:** Hardcoded enum. Custom passes (e.g., "security", "accessibility") cannot be added without schema changes.
- Default is `[]` (empty = single implicit dev pass)

### Elaborate Skill (Phase 5.95)
- Reads `default_passes` from `.ai-dlc/settings.yml` via yq
- If <2 entries: sets `passes: []`, `active_pass: ""` (skip)
- If >=2 entries: sets `passes` to configured array, `active_pass` to first entry
- Override via `.ai-dlc/{intent}/settings.yml`
- Unit template includes `pass: ""` field

### Execute Skill (Step 5c completion)
- On intent completion, checks for next pass in the sequence
- Parses `passes:` and `active_pass:` from intent.md via grep/sed
- If next pass exists: updates `active_pass`, notifies user to re-elaborate, saves `status=pass_transition`
- If no next pass: marks intent complete

### DAG Library (dag.sh)
- `parse_unit_pass()` function extracts `pass` field from unit frontmatter
- `find_ready_units_for_pass()` function filters ready units by active_pass
- When `active_pass` is empty, returns all ready units (backward compatible)

### Hook Injection (inject-context.sh and subagent-context.sh)
- **inject-context.sh** (lines 615-665): Hat resolution uses override pattern:
  1. Check `.ai-dlc/hats/${HAT}.md` (project override)
  2. If not found, check `${PLUGIN_ROOT}/hats/${HAT}.md` (plugin built-in)
  - Project file completely replaces plugin file (no augmentation)
  - **No pass context is injected** -- hats get no awareness of the active pass
- **subagent-context.sh** (lines 186-214): Same override pattern for hat resolution
  - Again, project `.ai-dlc/hats/` completely replaces plugin hats
  - No pass context injection

### Paper Documentation
- **Section: "Iteration Through Passes"** (line 373): Well-documented conceptual model with mermaid diagram showing design/product/dev passes with backward flow
- **Glossary entry "Pass"** (line 698): Documents pass structure, built-in types table, and frontmatter format
- **Note:** The paper shows pass frontmatter as `- type: design / status: completed` (structured objects), but the actual implementation uses flat string arrays (`passes: [design, dev]`). This is a paper-implementation mismatch.

### Website Docs (concepts.md)
- Lines 61-87: Pass types table, configuration example, basic explanation
- Lines 355-380: "When to Use Passes" section, backward flow diagram
- Fairly complete but lacks detail on pass-backs and lifecycle

### Workflows (workflows.yml)
- 6 named workflows: default, adversarial, design, hypothesis, tdd, bdd
- **No pass-to-workflow mapping** -- passes don't constrain which workflows are available
- The `design` workflow uses `[planner, designer, reviewer]` hats -- this is relevant for design passes but there's no mechanism linking them

### What's Missing (The Gap)
1. **No pass definition files** -- `plugin/passes/` directory doesn't exist
2. **No pass-to-hat context injection** -- hats don't know what pass they're in
3. **No per-pass workflow constraints** -- any workflow can be used in any pass
4. **No project-level pass customization** -- can't add/augment passes per project
5. **Hat resolution is override-only** -- project hats replace, not augment
6. **Settings schema hardcodes pass enum** -- can't add custom pass types
7. **Paper-implementation mismatch** on pass frontmatter format

## Codebase Pattern: Hat Resolution and Context Injection

### Current Hat Resolution Pattern

Both `inject-context.sh` (SessionStart hook) and `subagent-context.sh` (SubagentPrompt hook) use the same override pattern:

**inject-context.sh (lines 615-665):**
```bash
# Resolution order: 1) User override (.ai-dlc/hats/), 2) Plugin built-in (hats/)
HAT_FILE=""
if [ -f ".ai-dlc/hats/${HAT}.md" ]; then
  HAT_FILE=".ai-dlc/hats/${HAT}.md"
elif [ -n "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ] && [ -f "${PLUGIN_ROOT}/hats/${HAT}.md" ]; then
  HAT_FILE="${PLUGIN_ROOT}/hats/${HAT}.md"
fi
```

**subagent-context.sh (lines 186-214):**
```bash
if [ -f ".ai-dlc/hats/${HAT}.md" ]; then
  HAT_FILE=".ai-dlc/hats/${HAT}.md"
elif [ -n "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT" ] && [ -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hats/${HAT}.md" ]; then
  HAT_FILE="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hats/${HAT}.md"
fi
```

**Problem:** This is a pure override pattern -- if `.ai-dlc/hats/builder.md` exists, it completely replaces `plugin/hats/builder.md`. The user must copy the entire canonical hat definition just to add a few lines.

### Desired Pattern (from intent description)

The new pattern should be **augmentation, not override**:
1. Plugin hat definitions are canonical (always loaded)
2. Project `.ai-dlc/hats/{hat}.md` with matching name **appends** instructions
3. Project `.ai-dlc/hats/{hat}.md` with a new name is a custom hat (no plugin equivalent)

This matches how workflows already work -- `plugin/workflows.yml` provides defaults, `.ai-dlc/workflows.yml` can override/add entries. But for hats, we want append, not replace.

### Context Injection Insertion Point

Both hooks build context output as sequential echo statements. The hat injection is near the end:
- `inject-context.sh`: lines 627-665 (hat instructions section)
- `subagent-context.sh`: lines 185-215 (hat instructions section)

The pass context should be injected AFTER the hat instructions, as an additional context block. This is where pass definition instructions would go.

### Current Workflow Loading Pattern

Workflows use a merge pattern in `inject-context.sh` (lines 65-119):
1. Parse plugin workflows first
2. Parse project workflows (override or add by name)
3. Build merged workflow list

This is the precedent for the pass definition loading pattern.

### Provider Loading Pattern

Config.sh `load_provider_instructions()` (lines 374-412) uses a three-tier merge:
1. Built-in default (`plugin/providers/{category}.md`)
2. Inline instructions from settings.yml
3. Project override from `.ai-dlc/providers/{type}.md`

Each tier appends; nothing is replaced. This is closest to the desired hat/pass augmentation pattern.

## Architecture Decision: Pass Definition Files

### Proposed Structure

Create `plugin/passes/*.md` files with YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions:

```markdown
---
name: "Design"
description: "Visual and interaction design pass"
available_workflows: [design, default]
default_workflow: design
---

# Design Pass Instructions

When working in the design pass, focus on...
{instructions that get injected into hat context}
```

### File Location Resolution

Same pattern as providers (three-tier merge):

1. **Plugin built-in**: `plugin/passes/{pass-name}.md` (canonical, always loaded)
2. **Project augmentation**: `.ai-dlc/passes/{pass-name}.md` (appends to matching built-in)
3. **Project custom**: `.ai-dlc/passes/{new-name}.md` (new pass not in plugin)

Built-in pass definitions to create:
- `plugin/passes/design.md` -- design pass instructions
- `plugin/passes/product.md` -- product pass instructions
- `plugin/passes/dev.md` -- dev pass instructions (implicit default)

### Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
name: string          # Display name
description: string   # Short description
available_workflows:  # Workflows allowed in this pass
  - design
  - default
default_workflow: string  # Fallback workflow for units in this pass
```

### Injection Point

The pass definition instructions should be injected into hat context during construction (SessionStart and SubagentPrompt hooks):

1. Read `active_pass` from intent.md frontmatter
2. Load the pass definition (plugin + project augmentation)
3. Inject the pass instructions as a new section after hat instructions

This means modifying `inject-context.sh` and `subagent-context.sh` to:
- After loading hat instructions, check for active_pass
- If active_pass is set, load the pass definition
- Inject pass instructions as a `### Active Pass Context` section

### Workflow Constraint Enforcement

Currently `workflow-guard.sh` and the elaborate skill don't consider pass constraints. The implementation should:

1. During elaboration: when assigning workflows to units, check the active pass's `available_workflows`
2. During execution: `workflow-guard.sh` should verify the unit's workflow is allowed for the active pass
3. Fallback: if a unit requests a workflow not in the pass's list, use `default_workflow`

### Settings Schema Change

Current `default_passes` in `settings.schema.json`:
```json
"default_passes": {
  "type": "array",
  "items": { "type": "string", "enum": ["design", "product", "dev"] }
}
```

Should change to:
```json
"default_passes": {
  "type": "array",
  "items": { "type": "string" },
  "default": []
}
```

Any string is valid as long as a matching pass definition file exists (plugin or project level). Validation happens at runtime, not at schema level.

## Architecture Decision: Hat Augmentation Pattern

### Current vs. Proposed

**Current:** Project file replaces plugin file.
```
.ai-dlc/hats/builder.md  →  replaces  →  plugin/hats/builder.md
```

**Proposed:** Plugin file is always loaded. Project file with same name appends.
```
plugin/hats/builder.md     →  always loaded (canonical)
.ai-dlc/hats/builder.md   →  appended after (augmentation)
.ai-dlc/hats/my-custom.md →  standalone custom hat (no plugin equivalent)
```

### Implementation in inject-context.sh

Replace the current if/elif with:

```bash
# Always load plugin hat first (canonical)
HAT_CONTENT=""
PLUGIN_HAT="${PLUGIN_ROOT}/hats/${HAT}.md"
PROJECT_HAT=".ai-dlc/hats/${HAT}.md"

if [ -f "$PLUGIN_HAT" ]; then
  HAT_CONTENT=$(cat "$PLUGIN_HAT" | sed '1,/^---$/d' | sed '1,/^---$/d')
  NAME=$(dlc_frontmatter_get "name" "$PLUGIN_HAT")
  DESC=$(dlc_frontmatter_get "description" "$PLUGIN_HAT")
fi

# Append project augmentation (if exists and plugin hat exists)
if [ -f "$PROJECT_HAT" ] && [ -f "$PLUGIN_HAT" ]; then
  PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS=$(cat "$PROJECT_HAT" | sed '1,/^---$/d' | sed '1,/^---$/d')
  HAT_CONTENT="${HAT_CONTENT}

### Project Augmentation
${PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS}"
elif [ -f "$PROJECT_HAT" ] && [ ! -f "$PLUGIN_HAT" ]; then
  # Custom hat (no plugin equivalent)
  HAT_CONTENT=$(cat "$PROJECT_HAT" | sed '1,/^---$/d' | sed '1,/^---$/d')
  NAME=$(dlc_frontmatter_get "name" "$PROJECT_HAT")
  DESC=$(dlc_frontmatter_get "description" "$PROJECT_HAT")
fi
```

### Same Change in subagent-context.sh

The same pattern must be applied in `subagent-context.sh` lines 186-214.
