# unit-05-stage-definitions

## Description

Create the full stage definitions for both the ideation studio (4 stages) and the software studio (6 stages). Each stage gets a STAGE.md file with frontmatter defining hats, review mode, inputs list, and a body with per-hat guidance, criteria examples, and completion signals. Each stage also gets an `outputs/` directory with self-describing frontmatter docs that declare scope, location, format, and guidance for each output.

## Discipline

backend - Stage definition files with structured frontmatter and instructional body content.

## Technical Specification

### STAGE.md Schema

Each stage follows this structure:

```yaml
---
name: <stage-name>
description: <one-line description>
hats: [<ordered list of hat roles>]
review: auto | ask | external | [external, ask] | [external, auto]
unit_types: [<disciplines of units this stage creates>]
inputs:
  - stage: <producing-stage>
    output: <output-name>
---

# <Stage Name>

<Free-form purpose and philosophy>

## <hat-name>

<Guidance for this hat when active in this stage>

## Criteria Guidance

<How to write good criteria for this stage>

## Completion Signal

<When this stage is done>
```

No `requires:` or `produces:` fields. Inputs are qualified references (stage + output pairs) in frontmatter. A bare slug is ambiguous -- two stages could have outputs with the same name. Outputs are defined in the `outputs/` directory.

Inputs are loaded during the **plan phase** only. During the build phase, each unit declares its own `## References` section (see Unit References below).

### Output Docs

Each stage has an `outputs/` directory with self-describing frontmatter docs. These guide the agent on what to produce and declare where the output persists:

```
plugin/studios/software/stages/inception/
├── STAGE.md
└── outputs/
    └── DISCOVERY.md       # scope: intent, format: text
```

Each output doc follows this format:

```yaml
---
name: discovery
location: .haiku/intents/{intent-slug}/knowledge/DISCOVERY.md
scope: intent
format: text
required: true
---

# Discovery Output Guide

When exploring the domain, document:
- Every entity and its fields
- Every API endpoint and its behavior
...
```

Output doc fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Output identifier (referenced by other stages' `inputs:` as qualified `{stage, output}` pairs) |
| `location` | string | Path template where the output is persisted |
| `scope` | string | `project`, `intent`, `stage`, or `repo` |
| `format` | string | `text`, `code`, or `design` |
| `required` | boolean | Must be produced before stage completes |

Scopes:

| Scope | Persisted To | Lifespan |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `project` | `.haiku/knowledge/{name}.md` | Across intents |
| `intent` | `.haiku/intents/{intent-slug}/knowledge/{name}.md` | This intent |
| `stage` | `.haiku/intents/{intent-slug}/stages/{stage}/{name}` | This stage's units |
| `repo` | Project source tree | Permanent |

### Ideation Studio Stages

#### research

```yaml
---
name: research
description: Gather context, explore prior art, and understand the problem space
hats: [researcher, analyst]
review: auto
unit_types: [research]
inputs: []
---
```

- **researcher** hat: explore sources, gather data, synthesize findings
- **analyst** hat: evaluate findings, identify patterns, surface insights
- Review `auto` — research naturally flows into creation
- Outputs: `outputs/RESEARCH-BRIEF.md` (scope: intent)

#### create

```yaml
---
name: create
description: Generate the primary deliverable using research insights
hats: [creator, editor]
review: ask
unit_types: [content]
inputs:
  - stage: research
    output: research-brief
---
```

- **creator** hat: produce the primary output (document, design, plan, etc.)
- **editor** hat: refine, restructure, improve clarity and quality
- Review `ask` — the user decides when the draft is ready for formal review
- Outputs: `outputs/DRAFT-DELIVERABLE.md` (scope: intent)

#### review

---
name: review
description: Adversarial quality review of the deliverable
hats: [critic, fact-checker]

  - stage: create
    output: draft-deliverable
---
```

- **critic** hat: identify weaknesses, gaps, inconsistencies
- **fact-checker** hat: verify claims, check sources, validate logic
- Review `ask` — review findings are presented for the user to act on
- Outputs: `outputs/REVIEW-REPORT.md` (scope: intent)

#### deliver

```yaml
---
name: deliver
description: Finalize and package the deliverable for its audience
hats: [publisher]
review: auto
unit_types: [delivery]
inputs:
  - stage: create
    output: draft-deliverable
  - stage: review
    output: review-report
---
```

- **publisher** hat: format, package, and deliver
- Review `auto` — once review is addressed, delivery completes
- Outputs: `outputs/FINAL-DELIVERABLE.md` (scope: intent)

### Software Studio Stages

#### inception

```yaml
---
name: inception
description: Understand the problem, define success, and decompose into units
hats: [architect, decomposer]
review: auto
unit_types: [research, backend, frontend]
inputs: []
---
```

- **architect** hat: understand the problem space, define scope, identify technical constraints
- **decomposer** hat: break the intent into units with dependencies and criteria
- Review `auto` — inception flows directly into design
- This stage maps to the existing elaboration sub-skills: gather, discover, decompose, criteria, DAG
- Outputs: `outputs/DISCOVERY.md` (scope: intent)

#### design

```yaml
---
name: design
description: Visual and interaction design for user-facing surfaces
hats: [designer, design-reviewer]
review: ask
unit_types: [design, frontend]
inputs:
  - stage: inception
    output: discovery
---
```

- **designer** hat: explore wireframes, define tokens, specify component structure and states, map interaction flows
- **design-reviewer** hat: check consistency with design system, verify all states covered (default, hover, focus, active, disabled, error), confirm responsive behavior
- Review `ask` — design direction needs human approval before product proceeds
- Criteria guidance: screen layouts for all breakpoints, interactive states specified, touch targets >= 44px, design tokens only (no raw hex)
- Design criteria are verified by visual approval, not automated tests
- Outputs: `outputs/DESIGN-BRIEF.md` (scope: stage), `outputs/DESIGN-TOKENS.md` (scope: intent)

#### product

```yaml
---
name: product
description: Define behavioral specifications and acceptance criteria
hats: [product-owner, specification-writer]
review: [external, ask]
unit_types: [product, backend, frontend]
inputs:
  - stage: inception
    output: discovery
  - stage: design
    output: design-tokens
---
```

- **product-owner** hat: define user stories, prioritize, make scope decisions
- **specification-writer** hat: write behavioral specs, define data contracts, specify API contracts
- Review `[external, ask]` — the default is `external` (go/no-go decision boundary: creates a PR or review request for team approval). In autopilot mode, the orchestrator selects `ask` instead and overrides it to `auto`, so autopilot can proceed without a blocking external gate while the external review option remains available for normal runs.
- Criteria guidance: behavioral specs per user flow, data contracts defined, API contracts specified, edge cases documented
- Outputs: `outputs/BEHAVIORAL-SPEC.md` (scope: intent), `outputs/DATA-CONTRACTS.md` (scope: intent)

#### development

```yaml
---
name: development
description: Implement the specification through code
hats: [planner, builder, reviewer]
review: ask
unit_types: [backend, frontend, fullstack]
inputs:
  - stage: product
    output: behavioral-spec
  - stage: product
    output: data-contracts
---
```

- **planner** hat: read unit spec + prior stage outputs, plan implementation approach
- **builder** hat: write code, implement features, fix issues. Guided by behavioral spec from product stage.
- **reviewer** hat: code review, check criteria compliance, verify test coverage. Hard-gated on criteria.
- Review `ask` — pause for user review before operations
- This stage maps to the existing execute skill's bolt loop: plan -> build -> quality gates -> review
- Outputs: `outputs/CODE.md` (scope: repo), `outputs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (scope: project)

#### operations

```yaml
---
name: operations
description: Deployment, monitoring, and operational readiness
hats: [ops-engineer, sre]
review: auto
unit_types: [ops, backend]
inputs:
  - stage: development
    output: code
  - stage: development
    output: architecture
---
```

- **ops-engineer** hat: configure deployment, set up CI/CD, define infrastructure
- **sre** hat: define SLOs, set up monitoring, write runbooks
- Review `auto` — operational setup advances automatically when complete
- Criteria guidance: deployment pipeline defined, monitoring covers key metrics, runbook exists for common failure modes
- Outputs: `outputs/RUNBOOK.md` (scope: intent), `outputs/DEPLOYMENT-CONFIG.md` (scope: repo)

#### security

```yaml
---
name: security
description: Threat modeling, security review, and vulnerability assessment
hats: [threat-modeler, red-team, blue-team, security-reviewer]
review: [external, ask]
unit_types: [security, backend]
inputs:
  - stage: product
    output: behavioral-spec
  - stage: development
    output: code
---
```

- **threat-modeler** hat: STRIDE threat modeling for all data flows and trust boundaries
- **red-team** hat: attack surface analysis, injection testing, auth bypass attempts
- **blue-team** hat: defense verification, security control validation, monitoring coverage
- **security-reviewer** hat: verify all threats have mitigations, check OWASP Top 10 coverage
- Review `[external, ask]` — the default is `external` (security findings require team review before the intent ships: creates a PR or review request). In autopilot mode, the orchestrator selects `ask` and overrides it to `auto`, allowing autopilot to proceed after the adversarial review phase completes.
- This stage is always adversarial — the hat sequence IS the review
- Criteria guidance: OWASP Top 10 coverage, auth boundary testing, data protection requirements, input validation
- Outputs: `outputs/THREAT-MODEL.md` (scope: intent), `outputs/VULN-REPORT.md` (scope: intent)

### Unit References

Unit specs get a `## References` section populated during the plan phase. This lists the specific knowledge artifacts the builder agent needs for that unit:

```markdown
## References
- .haiku/intents/{intent-slug}/knowledge/DISCOVERY.md
- .haiku/intents/{intent-slug}/knowledge/BEHAVIORAL-SPEC.md
```

The builder agent reads ONLY these files, not the entire knowledge pool or the full stage input set. This is populated during the plan phase based on what the unit actually needs -- derived from the stage's resolved inputs and the unit's specific scope of work.

This prevents context bloat: a stage might declare 5 inputs, but a given unit only needs 2 of them. The plan phase uses the full picture for decomposition; the build phase uses only what each unit requires.

### Hat Section Content

Each hat section in the STAGE.md body follows this pattern:

```markdown
## <hat-name>

### Focus
- Bullet points describing what this hat does

### Produces
- Artifact types this hat generates

### Reads
- What prior artifacts this hat consumes (from unit's ## References)

### Anti-patterns
- What this hat should NOT do
```

This replaces the old `plugin/hats/*.md` files -- all hat instructions live as files in each stage's `hats/` directory (e.g., `stages/development/hats/builder.md`). During the build phase, hats read the unit's `## References` section for context, not the full stage input set.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All 4 ideation studio stage files exist with complete frontmatter and body
- [ ] All 6 software studio stage files exist with complete frontmatter and body
- [ ] Every stage has `hats`, `review`, `unit_types`, and `inputs` in frontmatter
- [ ] Every stage has an `outputs/` directory with at least one output doc
- [ ] Every output doc has `name`, `location`, `scope`, `format`, `required` in frontmatter
- [ ] Every stage body has sections for each hat defined in frontmatter
- [ ] Every stage body has `## Criteria Guidance` and `## Completion Signal` sections
- [ ] Input/output chains are consistent: every `inputs` entry's `output` name appears as an output `name` in the referenced `stage`'s `outputs/` directory
- [ ] All `inputs` entries use qualified references (`stage` + `output` pairs), not bare slugs
- [ ] Hat section `### Reads` subsections reference the unit's `## References` pattern, not the stage input set directly
- [ ] Software stage review modes match spec: inception=auto, design=ask, product=[external,ask], development=ask, operations=auto, security=[external,ask]
- [ ] Ideation stage review modes match spec: research=auto, create=ask, review=ask, deliver=auto
- [ ] Hat sections provide actionable guidance (not just labels)
- [ ] Criteria guidance sections include good/bad examples

## Risks

- **Content quality**: Hat instructions need to be genuinely useful, not placeholder text. Mitigation: adapt content from existing `plugin/hats/*.md` files and `plugin/passes/*.md` (now stages) which have battle-tested guidance.
- **Input/output mismatch**: If stage A's outputs include `x` and `y` but stage B's inputs list `[x, z]`, the pipeline has a gap. Mitigation: trace the full input/output chain for each studio before writing files.
- **Ideation generality**: The ideation studio must work for ANY domain (marketing, hardware, legal, etc.). Mitigation: keep hat descriptions generic and outcome-focused rather than domain-specific.

## Boundaries

This unit writes STAGE.md content and `outputs/` directory docs for both studios. It does NOT create the studio infrastructure (unit-04), the orchestrator (unit-06), or remove the old hats directory (unit-07). The stage files and output docs are passive definitions — they become active when the orchestrator reads them.
