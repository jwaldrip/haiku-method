# Studio Architecture Spec

## Summary

AI-DLC's elaboration was a 2,400-line monolithic skill file that hard-coded knowledge about three disciplines — design, product, and dev. It ran the same phases regardless of context, had no concept of development lifecycles beyond software, and couldn't support organizations with custom workflows.

This spec redesigns the system around three concepts:

- **Studio** — a named development lifecycle (the ordered sequence of stages a team follows). Software teams use inception → design → product → development → operations → security. Hardware teams, security-focused teams, or any organization defines their own by dropping files in `.ai-dlc/studios/`.
- **Stage** — a lifecycle phase that defines its own hats (roles), review mode, and outputs. Each stage runs the same internal loop: elaborate → execute → adversarial review → review gate. One `STAGE.md` per stage contains everything. No separate workflow files, hat directories, or phase files.
- **Inputs/Outputs** — stages declare inputs (a simple list in STAGE.md frontmatter) and outputs (self-describing frontmatter docs in an `outputs/` directory). Output scopes control persistence: `project` (`.haiku/knowledge/`), `intent` (`.haiku/intents/{name}/knowledge/`), `stage` (working context), `repo` (source tree).

The key insight is that stages aren't just elaboration modes — they're the full lifecycle. Design doesn't just spec wireframes, it builds them. Product doesn't just define criteria, it writes behavioral specs. Each stage completes its own elaborate → execute cycle and produces real artifacts before the next stage begins.

**The default experience doesn't change.** The studio always exists (default: software). The user chooses per-intent whether to run **continuous** (autopilot drives stage transitions, user reviews at gates) or **discrete** (user explicitly invokes each stage). Continuous mode is how AI-DLC works today — one guided session through all stages. Discrete mode expands the same pipeline into user-driven steps.

### What this eliminates

- `plugin/hats/` directory — hats are now defined inside each stage's STAGE.md
- `plugin/workflows.yml` — each stage defines its own hat sequence; the studio defines stage ordering
- Workflow selection sub-skill — no need to pick a workflow; the stage already knows its hats
- `phases/ELABORATION.md` and `phases/EXECUTION.md` — the stage body is injected as context; no structured phase files
- `knowledge/` directory inside stages — replaced by `outputs/` directory with self-describing frontmatter docs
- `requires:` / `produces:` fields in STAGE.md — replaced by `inputs:` (frontmatter list) and `outputs/` (directory)

## Problem

The elaborate skill was a monolithic 2400-line file with hard-coded knowledge about specific disciplines (design, product, dev). It couldn't support custom lifecycle configurations — a security team, hardware team, or any organization with non-standard development workflows had no way to define their own elaboration and execution behavior.

## Goal

A fully data-driven architecture where:
1. **Studios** define named lifecycle pipelines (e.g., `software: inception → design → product → development → operations → security`)
2. **Stages** define what a lifecycle phase produces, consumes, and how it operates (hats, review mode, guidance)
3. The system supports **continuous** (autopilot between gates) and **discrete** (user-driven) modes through the same stage pipeline
4. **Nothing breaks** — continuous mode (the default choice) works exactly as AI-DLC does today

## Hierarchy

```
Studio → Stages → Units → Bolts
```

| Level | Agile Equivalent | Description |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Studio** | (no equivalent) | Named pipeline of stages — the team's development lifecycle template |
| **Stage** | (no equivalent) | A lifecycle phase with defined inputs/outputs (design, product, dev, security, etc.) |
| **Unit** | Ticket / Story | A discrete piece of work within an intent |
| **Bolt** | Sprint | The iteration cycle an agent runs within a unit |

```

## File Schemas

### STUDIO.md

```yaml
---
name: software
description: Standard software development lifecycle
stages: [design, product, dev]
---
```

The body contains free-form documentation about when to use this studio, its philosophy, etc.

### STAGE.md

Contains structural metadata that applies to both elaboration and execution:

```yaml
---
name: design
description: Visual and interaction design
hats: [designer, design-reviewer]
review: ask
unit_types: [design, frontend]
inputs: [discovery, intent-spec]
---
```

The body contains free-form documentation about the stage's purpose and philosophy, including per-hat guidance sections.

Inputs are a simple list of output names from prior stages. The orchestrator resolves each name to the persisted location based on the producing stage's output scope.

Outputs are defined in the `outputs/` directory alongside STAGE.md — each output is a separate file with self-describing frontmatter (see Output Doc Schema below).

Fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Stage identifier |
| `description` | string | One-line description |
| `hats` | string[] | Ordered hat roles for this stage's build phase |
| `review` | string | Review gate mode: `auto`, `ask`, or `external` |
| `unit_types` | string[] | Disciplines of units this stage creates (e.g., `[design, frontend]`) |
| `inputs` | string[] | Output names from prior stages this stage needs |

### Output Doc Schema

Each file in a stage's `outputs/` directory:

```yaml
---
name: discovery
location: .haiku/intents/{name}/knowledge/DISCOVERY.md
scope: intent
format: text
required: true
---

# Discovery Output Guide

When exploring the domain, document:
- Every entity and its fields
- Every API endpoint and its behavior
- Architecture patterns and constraints
```

Fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Output identifier (referenced by other stages' `inputs:` lists) |
| `location` | string | Path template where the output is persisted (uses `{name}` for intent slug) |
| `scope` | string | Persistence scope: `project`, `intent`, `stage`, or `repo` |
| `format` | string | Content format: `text`, `code`, `design` |
| `required` | boolean | Whether this output must be produced before the stage completes |

Output scopes determine persistence:

| Scope | Location | Lifespan |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `project` | `.haiku/knowledge/{name}.md` | Persists across intents |
| `intent` | `.haiku/intents/{name}/knowledge/{name}.md` | This intent only |
| `stage` | `.haiku/intents/{name}/stages/{stage}/{name}` | Working context for this stage's units |
| `repo` | Project source tree | Actual code, configs — permanent |

## The Collapsible FSM

### States

```
INIT → GATHER → DISCOVER → [ELABORATE(stage) → EXECUTE(stage)]* → DELIVER
```

Where `[ELABORATE → EXECUTE]*` repeats for each stage in the studio pipeline.

### Single-Stage Mode (Collapsed)

User chooses "single-stage" during elaboration:

```
GATHER → DISCOVER → ELABORATE(all) → EXECUTE(all) → DELIVER
                        ↓
                    one cycle, all disciplines merged
```

One elaborate ↓ execute cycle. All stage definitions from the studio are merged. Sub-skills use the union of all stages' guidance.

### Multi-Stage Mode (Expanded)

User chooses "multi-stage" during elaboration:

```
                    ┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐   ┌──────────┐
GATHER → DISCOVER → │ ELABORATE │ → │ ELABORATE │ → │ ELABORATE │ → DELIVER
                    │     ↓     │   │     ↓     │   │     ↓     │
                    │  EXECUTE  │   │  EXECUTE  │   │  EXECUTE  │
                    │  design   │   │  product  │   │   dev     │
                    └──────────┘   └──────────┘   └──────────┘
                         │              │              │
                    built artifacts → built artifacts → built artifacts
```

Each stage transition:
1. Reads `stages/{name}/STAGE.md` for structural metadata (hats, inputs, guidance)
2. Reads `stages/{name}/outputs/*.md` for output definitions (scope, format, location)
3. Resolves inputs from prior stage outputs via scope-based locations
4. Runs the invariant elaboration core parameterized by the stage's metadata
5. Executes the stage's units (bolt cycles guided by STAGE.md hat sections)
6. Writes outputs to scope-based locations — these become inputs for the next stage

### The Collapse Operation

Single-stage mode is conceptually equivalent to merging all stage definitions and running once:

- `unit_types` = union of all stages' unit types
- `criteria_guidance` = concatenation of all stages' guidance
- `artifact_types` = union of all stages' artifacts
- `available_workflows` = union of all stages' workflows
- `inputs` = empty (first stage)
- `outputs` = union of all stages' output definitions

In practice, single-stage mode doesn't actually read stage definitions — it uses the sub-skills' built-in behavior, which produces the same result as the merge.

## Execution Model

### Hat Layering

Hats (planner, builder, reviewer, designer, etc.) are generic workers defined in `plugin/hats/*.md`. They gain stage-specific context through layering:

| Layer | Source | Single-Stage | Multi-Stage |
|-------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 1. Hat | STAGE.md `## {hat-name}` section | Always read | Always read |
| 2. Outputs | Stage's `outputs/` directory definitions | Merged | Active stage only |
| 3. Inputs | Resolved from prior stage outputs | N/A | Read for active stage |
| 4. Unit | `.haiku/{slug}/stages/{stage}/units/unit-NN-*.md` | Always read | Always read |

In single-stage mode, all stage definitions are merged and hat guidance comes from the combined STAGE.md. In multi-stage mode, the active stage's STAGE.md provides hat-specific guidance and the stage's `inputs:` list drives what prior artifacts are loaded.

### Bolt Cycle

Each unit executes through bolt cycles until its criteria are met:

```
Unit → Resolve hat sequence from STAGE.md
         │
         ├── Planner hat    → reads STAGE.md ## planner + unit spec + inputs
         ├── Builder hat    → reads STAGE.md ## builder + unit spec + inputs
         ├── Quality gates  → tests, lint, typecheck (backpressure)
         └── Reviewer hat   → reads STAGE.md ## reviewer + criteria + outputs/ defs
                │
                ├── Criteria met → advance to next unit
                └── Issues found → another bolt cycle
```

### Single-Stage Execution

All units execute together in dependency order. Each unit uses its own workflow (design units → design workflow, backend units → default workflow). Hats use built-in instructions only. All workflows are available. When all units complete → deliver.

### Multi-Stage Execution

Only units tagged with the active stage execute. Hats read the active stage's STAGE.md for guidance. The stage's `inputs:` list drives what prior artifacts are loaded. The reviewer checks stage-specific criteria and verifies required outputs are produced. When all stage units complete, outputs are written to their scope-based locations, and the orchestrator advances to the next stage.

```
Stage: design
  ├── Filter: units where stage: design
  ├── Resolve inputs: [discovery, intent-spec] → read from prior output locations
  ├── Hat guidance: stages/design/STAGE.md ## {hat-name} sections
  ├── Execute bolt cycles per unit
  ├── Write outputs: DESIGN-BRIEF.md (scope: stage), DESIGN-TOKENS.md (scope: intent)
  └── All design units done → advance to product stage
```

## Settings

```yaml
# .haiku/settings.yml
studio: software    # Always present. Default: "software" if omitted.
```

Every project has a studio. Omitting `studio:` defaults to `software`. The per-intent decision of single-stage vs multi-stage is made during elaboration, not in settings.

Resolution order:
1. Project-level: `.haiku/studios/{name}/STUDIO.md`
2. Built-in: `plugin/studios/{name}/STUDIO.md`

## Intent Frontmatter

```yaml
---
studio: software                  # Which studio this intent uses
stages: [design, product, dev]   # Resolved from studio (empty for single-stage)
active_stage: design              # Current stage being elaborated/executed (empty for single-stage)
---
```

Single-stage intent: `stages: []`, `active_stage: ""`, `studio: "software"` (studio is always set).

## Unit Frontmatter

```yaml
---
stage: design                    # Which stage created this unit
---
```

When no studio is configured: `stage: ""`.

## Resolution Logic

### Studio Resolution

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/studio.sh"

# Returns comma-separated stage names, or "" for single-stage
STAGES=$(resolve_active_stages)
```

`resolve_active_stages` reads `studio:` from settings.yml, validates the studio and all its stages exist, and returns the stage list. Returns `""` when no studio is configured.

### Stage Resolution (within a studio)

```bash
source "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/stage.sh"

# Resolves relative to the active studio
STAGE_FILE=$(resolve_stage_definition "design" "software")
# → plugin/studios/software/stages/design/STAGE.md
```

### Output Resolution (within a stage)

The orchestrator reads output definitions from the stage's `outputs/` directory:

```bash
STAGE_DIR=$(dirname "$(hku_resolve_stage "$STAGE_NAME" "$STUDIO_NAME")")
OUTPUTS_DIR="${STAGE_DIR}/outputs/"
# Each *.md file in outputs/ is a self-describing output doc with frontmatter
```

### Input Resolution

Inputs listed in STAGE.md frontmatter are resolved by finding the matching output definition from a prior stage and reading from its persisted location:

```bash
# For each input name in STAGE.md inputs: [discovery, intent-spec]
# 1. Find which prior stage produces an output with that name
# 2. Read the output's scope and location from the producing stage's outputs/ dir
# 3. Read the persisted file from the scope-based path
```

## Sub-Skill Parameterization

Sub-skills are generic — they contain no hard-coded knowledge about specific stages. They read guidance from the active stage's phase files:

| Sub-Skill | Reads From | What It Gets |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `criteria` | `STAGE.md` → `## Criteria Guidance` | Good/bad examples, focus area |
| `decompose` | `STAGE.md` → `unit_types` | Allowed unit disciplines |
| `wireframes` | `STAGE.md` → hat sections | Whether design hats are present |
| Builder hat | `STAGE.md` → `## {hat-name}` section | Construction guidance |
| Reviewer hat | `STAGE.md` → `## {hat-name}` section | Review guidance |
| Advance | `STAGE.md` → `## Completion Signal` | When to advance |
| Output writer | `outputs/*.md` → frontmatter | Scope, location, format for each output |
| Input loader | `STAGE.md` → `inputs:` list | Names of outputs to load from prior stages |

## Custom Stage Example: Security

A company adds a security stage to the software studio:

```
.haiku/studios/software/
├── STUDIO.md                          # Override: stages: [design, product, security, dev]
└── stages/
    └── security/
        ├── STAGE.md
        └── outputs/
            ├── THREAT-MODEL.md        # scope: intent, format: text
            ├── SECURITY-REQS.md       # scope: intent, format: text
            └── VULN-REPORT.md         # scope: intent, format: text
```

**STAGE.md:**
```yaml
---
name: security
description: Threat modeling and penetration testing
hats: [threat-modeler, red-team, blue-team, reviewer]
review: external
unit_types: [security, backend]
inputs: [behavioral-spec, implementation]
---

# Security Stage

## threat-modeler

### Focus
- Perform STRIDE threat modeling for all data flows and trust boundaries
- Identify attack surface and categorize threats

## red-team

### Focus
- Write security-focused tests: injection, auth bypass, CSRF, SSRF
- Review dependencies for known CVEs

## blue-team

### Focus
- Verify mitigations for all identified threats
- Validate security controls

## reviewer

### Focus
- Verify all identified threats have documented mitigations
- Check security test coverage against OWASP Top 10

## Criteria Guidance

- OWASP Top 10 coverage for all endpoints
- Authentication and authorization boundary testing
- Data protection requirements (encryption at rest, in transit)
- Input validation and output encoding

## Completion Signal

All identified threats have documented mitigations, security tests cover the
attack surface, and no critical/high findings remain unaddressed.
```

**outputs/THREAT-MODEL.md:**
```yaml
---
name: threat-model
location: .haiku/intents/{name}/knowledge/THREAT-MODEL.md
scope: intent
format: text
required: true
---

# Threat Model Output Guide

Document all identified threats with:
- STRIDE classification
- Attack vectors and impact assessment
- Mitigations (implemented and recommended)
```

## Custom Studio Example: Hardware

```
.haiku/studios/hardware/
├── STUDIO.md
└── stages/
    ├── requirements/
    │   ├── STAGE.md
    │   └── outputs/
    │       └── REQUIREMENTS-SPEC.md         # scope: intent, format: text

```

## Migration Path

1. ~~Extract shared phases into sub-skills~~ (done)
2. ~~Rename pass → stage~~ (done)
3. ~~Create studio infrastructure~~ (done — STUDIO.md, studio.sh, stage.sh)
4. Replace `knowledge/` directories with `outputs/` directories containing self-describing frontmatter docs
5. Replace `requires:`/`produces:` with `inputs:` (frontmatter list) and `outputs/` (directory)
6. Update sub-skills and hats to read guidance from STAGE.md body sections
7. Update settings schema (studio: field replaces default_stages)
8. Update paper, website docs, and CLAUDE.md terminology
9. Delete REFACTOR-SPEC.md (superseded by this spec)

## Backwards Compatibility

**Single-stage mode (no studio configured) MUST work identically to the current system.** This means:
- No `studio:` in settings → `stages: []`, `active_stage: ""`
- Sub-skills use built-in defaults when no stage definition is available
- No STAGE.md or outputs/ files are read
- The elaboration and execution flows are unchanged from the current working system
