## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Visual fidelity backpressure: reviewer captures screenshots and compares against design references using AI vision
- Pluggable screenshot capture with Playwright (web) and manual (any platform) providers
- Design reference resolution with 3-level priority hierarchy (external design > previous iteration > wireframe)
- `design_ref:` and `views:` unit frontmatter fields for explicit design linking and screenshot targeting
- Auto-detection heuristic for units that produce user-visible output (5-point gate: discipline, design_ref, wireframe, UI file extensions, UI terms in spec)
- Fidelity-aware comparison with adjustable tolerance (high/medium/low) via structured vision prompt
- Visual fidelity hard gate: reviewer blocks approval on high-severity visual findings or infrastructure failures
- Capture interface contract (`capture-interface.md`) defining provider plugin system, manifest schema, and exit codes
