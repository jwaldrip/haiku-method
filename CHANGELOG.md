# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.82.13] - 2026-04-01

### Changed
- Reorganized internal subskills to nest under their parent skill directories for clearer plugin structure.

### Fixed
- Corrected stale command references and paths throughout skill definitions and artifacts to ensure proper subskill invocation.

## [1.82.12] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Agent teams created during a unit are now properly cleaned up when the unit completes.

## [1.82.11] - 2026-04-01

Looking at the commits since 1.82.10, there is only one feature:

**Commits analyzed:**
- feat: AI-synthesized changelog and full version backfill (scripts, workflow automation, changelog regeneration)

This is purely an internal tooling improvement — it doesn't change plugin functionality or user behavior. Following the rule to "skip noise" unless it changes user behavior, there are **no user-facing changes to document** for 1.82.11.

If you'd like to document the internal improvement, one minimal option would be:

```
### Changed
- Changelog generation is now AI-synthesized for consistency across release notes.
```

But strictly speaking, this is a tooling-only patch with no user-facing changes.

## [1.83.1] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed
- Reverted Visual Review full integration pending further development.

## [1.82.8] - 2026-04-01

## [1.82.5] - 2026-03-30

Looking at the single commit provided (chore: update plugin source path variable), this is internal infrastructure maintenance that doesn't affect user-facing functionality. Per the rules to skip noise and focus on what users can DO differently, there are no sections with content for this version.

## [1.75.1] - 2026-03-28

I need more details to write a meaningful changelog entry. The commit message "comprehensive review fixes after PR merge barrage" is too generic—it doesn't specify what was actually fixed.

Can you provide either:
1. **The actual file changes** from that commit (what was modified/fixed), or
2. **Specific issues addressed** (e.g., "fixed edge case in advance skill", "improved error handling in execute", etc.)

Without knowing the concrete improvements, I can't write user-facing bullets that explain what they can now do differently.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed

- Session retrospectives now correctly handle branch ordering and workflow transitions
- Team mode hats now function properly in multi-agent workflows
- Merge strategy now executes as configured

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-11

- Domain discovery during elaboration helps you systematically explore your problem space before constructing solutions
- Specification validation during elaboration catches design issues early in the inception phase
- Deep research capabilities help you gather comprehensive context about relevant technologies and approaches

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-11

I need more detail about what changed in the settings. The commit message "update settings" doesn't reveal what a plugin user can now do differently.

Can you clarify:
- What settings were added, changed, or removed?
- What's the user-facing impact? (e.g., new configuration option, default behavior change, etc.)

Once I understand that, I'll write the changelog entry.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Agent Teams with intent-level modes and dynamic hat discovery
- Interactive workflow visualizer on documentation website
- Website responsive layout and dark mode

### Changed
- Construction workflows now use Agent Teams by default

### Fixed
- Session startup performance optimized
