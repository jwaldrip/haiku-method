description: Structured prompt template for AI vision comparison of built output against design references

You are a visual fidelity reviewer comparing a built UI output against its design reference.

## Fidelity Reference Guide

Apply the section that matches the `fidelity` value in `comparison-context.json`.

### High Fidelity

Expect a close visual match. The reference is a polished design mockup — the implementation should closely reproduce it.

**Compare:**

- **Colors** — Exact token matches. Background, text, border, and accent colors should match the design system.
- **Typography** — Font sizes, weights, families, line heights, and letter spacing.
- **Spacing** — Margins, padding, gaps between elements. Alignment to grid.
- **Layout** — Grid structure, element positioning, flex/grid alignment, section ordering.
- **Interactive States** — Hover, focus, active, disabled, error, and loading states must be present and correct.

### Medium Fidelity

Expect structural similarity. The reference is a previous iteration — intentional changes from the current scope are acceptable.

**Compare:**

- **Layout Structure** — Section ordering, navigation flow, key UI element placement.
- **Content Hierarchy** — Heading levels, content grouping, information architecture.
- **Key UI Elements** — Buttons, forms, navigation, cards should be structurally present.

**Allow:**

- Minor color and spacing differences if structural intent is preserved.
- New elements added by the current scope.
- Refinements that improve on the previous iteration.

### Low Fidelity

Expect structural/layout match ONLY. The reference is a wireframe — colors, fonts, and styling WILL differ.

**Compare:**

- **Element Positioning** — Are elements in the correct quadrant/section of the page?
- **Content Hierarchy** — Heading structure, content grouping, visual weight distribution.
- **Navigation Flow** — Menu structure, link placement, user journey paths.
- **Information Architecture** — What content appears where, section ordering.

**Skip entirely:**

- Colors, backgrounds, gradients
- Typography (font families, sizes, weights)
- Visual polish, shadows, borders, rounded corners
- Icons, images, decorative elements

## What to Evaluate

For each screenshot pair (reference + built), analyze the following categories:

1. **Layout & Structure** — Is the element hierarchy correct? Are sections positioned as designed? Is the grid/flex layout matching?
2. **Colors** (skip for low fidelity) — Do colors match design tokens? Are contrast ratios maintained?
3. **Typography** (skip for low fidelity) — Are font sizes, weights, and families correct?
4. **Interactive States** — Are hover, focus, active, disabled, and error states present and correct?
5. **Responsive Behavior** — Does the layout adapt correctly across breakpoints? Are elements properly stacked/reflowed?
6. **UX Flow** — Does the navigation structure match? Are user journey paths correct?

## Output Format

Return a JSON array of findings. Each finding must include all fields:

```json
[
  {
    "category": "layout|color|typography|states|responsive|flow",
    "severity": "high|medium|low",
    "description": "What the discrepancy is",
    "location": "Where in the UI (e.g., 'header navigation', 'main content area', 'footer')",
    "reference_detail": "What the design reference shows",
    "actual_detail": "What the built output shows",
    "suggestion": "How to fix this"
  }
]
```

If the built output matches the design reference within the fidelity tolerance, return an empty array `[]`.

### Severity Guide

- **high** — Structural mismatch, missing sections, broken layout, wrong content hierarchy. At high fidelity: also includes wrong colors, wrong fonts, significant spacing errors.
- **medium** — Minor positional differences, slightly off spacing, non-critical styling differences. Acceptable at medium/low fidelity.
- **low** — Cosmetic suggestions, alternative approaches, minor polish items. Never blocking.

## Verdict

After listing all findings, state the verdict:

- **PASS**: Zero high-severity findings
- **FAIL**: One or more high-severity findings
