# H·AI·K·U New Intent

## Name

`haiku:new` - Start a new H·AI·K·U intent with studio and stage configuration.

## Synopsis

```
/haiku:new [description]
/haiku:new --template <template-name> [--param key=value ...]
```

## Description

**User-facing command** - Creates a new intent with studio detection, mode selection, and workspace initialization. This replaces the "gather intent" portion of the old elaborate flow.

### Template Mode

When `--template` is provided, the intent is seeded from a studio template file:

1. **Resolve the template**: Look in `plugin/studios/{studio}/templates/{name}.md` and `.haiku/studios/{studio}/templates/{name}.md` (project override takes precedence).
2. **Parse parameters**: Extract `parameters:` from template frontmatter. Match `--param key=value` arguments against required parameters. If required parameters are missing, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`.
3. **Apply parameter substitution**: Replace `{{ param }}` placeholders in unit criteria and content.
4. **Create units**: Write pre-filled unit files from the template's `units:` section to the appropriate stage directories.
5. **Apply stage override**: If the template specifies `stages-override:`, only those stages are active (others skipped).
6. **Skip elaboration**: Since units are pre-defined, the first `/haiku:resume` skips the elaboration step and goes straight to execution.

**Example:**
```
/haiku:new --template new-prospect --param company="Acme Corp" --param source=referral
```

This creates a sales intent pre-filled with units for Acme Corp, with criteria like "Acme Corp business model and pain points documented."

**Relationship to other commands:**
- `/haiku:new` creates the intent and workspace
- `/haiku:resume` advances the intent through its stages (plan, build, review, gate)
- `/haiku:elaborate` is now a backward-compatibility alias that delegates to this flow

## Pre-checks (RFC 2119)

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "REQUIRED" in this section are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. **Reject cowork mode:** The agent **MUST NOT** run this skill in cowork mode. If `CLAUDE_CODE_IS_COWORK=1`, the agent **MUST** stop immediately with the error below. The agent **SHALL NOT** proceed under any circumstances.
   ```bash
   if [ "${CLAUDE_CODE_IS_COWORK:-}" = "1" ]; then
     echo "ERROR: /haiku:new cannot run in cowork mode."
     echo "Please run from a standard Claude Code CLI session."
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

2. **Verify git repo:** The agent **MUST** be in a git repository. Execution outside a git repo is **NOT** permitted.

3. **Check for existing active intent:** If `.haiku/intents/*/intent.md` has an active intent, the agent **MUST** warn the user and confirm whether to create a new intent or resume the existing one.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Gather Intent

If an argument is provided, use it as the intent description. Otherwise ask the user directly in the conversation:

> What do you want to accomplish?

Wait for the user's text reply. Do NOT use `AskUserQuestion` for this — it's a free-text conversational prompt.

### Step 2: Extract Slug

Convert the intent description to a kebab-case slug:
- Lowercase
- Replace spaces and special characters with hyphens
- Remove consecutive hyphens
- Max 40 characters
- Trim trailing hyphens

### Step 3: Detect Studio

Studio is a **per-intent decision** — the agent **MUST** recommend based on the nature of the work, not a static project default.

#### 3a. Check for project-level override

Check for a project-level studio constraint:
```bash
haiku_settings_get { field: "studio" }
```

If set, verify it exists via `haiku_studio_get { studio: "<name>" }`. If valid, use it — the project has explicitly constrained studio selection. Skip to Step 4.

#### 3b. Recommend studio from intent

If no project-level studio is set (or the field is empty):

1. **Scan available studios:** Call `haiku_studio_list` to get all available studios with their name, description, stages, category, and body summary. This returns both built-in and project-level studios (project-level takes precedence on name collisions).

2. **Match against intent description:** Compare the user's intent description against each studio's description, category, stage names, and body text. Consider:
   - Does the intent's domain match the studio's category?
   - Do the studio's stages represent a natural lifecycle for this work?
   - Does the studio's description or body text address the kind of problem described?

3. **Decision logic:**

   **Clear signal (one studio is obviously right):** Select it and inform the user with a one-line rationale. Do not ask for confirmation — move on.
   ```
   Studio: migration (your intent is about remediating a system from a known-bad state to a known-good state)
   ```

   **Ambiguous (2-3 plausible fits):** Present the top candidates with a brief rationale for each. Ask the user to pick using `AskUserQuestion`.
   ```
   This intent could fit a few studios:

   1. **migration** — assessment → mapping → migrate → validation → cutover
      Fits because: you're taking a system from a known-bad state to a known-good state

   2. **data-pipeline** — discovery → extraction → transformation → validation → deployment
      Fits because: the core work is data quality remediation

   Which studio fits best? (or describe what you're thinking and I'll adjust)
   ```

   **No clear fit:** Default to `ideation` and inform the user. Ideation is the general-purpose studio.

#### 3c. Validate

Verify the selected studio exists via `haiku_studio_get { studio: "<name>" }`. If it returns empty, fall back to `ideation` with a warning.

### Step 4: Set Mode

The agent **MUST** default to **continuous** mode. The agent **MUST NOT** ask the user — this is a per-intent decision the agent makes based on the work:

- **Continuous** (default): Agent drives through all stages. User reviews at gates. Best for most intents.
- **Discrete**: Each stage runs independently. Use for exploratory work where the user wants to pause and think between stages.
- **Hybrid**: Discrete for early stages (inception, design, product), continuous from a threshold stage onward. Set `continuous_from:` to the stage where continuous begins.

The agent **SHALL** only use discrete/hybrid if the intent's nature clearly calls for it. The agent **MUST NOT** ask.

**Hybrid mode:** Discrete up to a named stage, then continuous from that stage onward. Best when early stages need human pacing (research, strategy) but later stages can be agent-driven (execution, validation).

Options:
1. **Continuous** — I'll drive, you review at gates
2. **Discrete** — I'll invoke each stage separately
3. **Hybrid** — Discrete until _____, then continuous

Default: `continuous`

**If hybrid is selected:** Present the studio's stage list and ask which stage marks the transition to continuous. Record this as `continuous_from` in the intent frontmatter. The stage named is the first stage that runs in continuous mode — all stages before it are discrete.

**Note on await/external gates:** Gates with `review: await` or `review: external` always pause regardless of mode — they require an external trigger by definition. Hybrid mode only affects `review: auto` gate behavior.

**When called from `/haiku:autopilot`:** The agent **MUST** skip this question. The agent **MUST** use `continuous` mode automatically (the autopilot skill passes the mode).

### Step 5: Resolve Stages

Load the stage list from the studio definition:
```bash
haiku_studio_get { studio: "<selected_studio>" }
# Parse the stages array from the returned JSON
```

For continuous mode, `stages:` in the intent frontmatter is set to `[]` and `active_stage:` to `""` (no stage tracking — the run command handles the collapse).

For discrete or hybrid mode, `stages:` lists all stages and `active_stage:` is set to the first stage.

### Step 6: Create Intent File

Write `.haiku/intents/{slug}/intent.md` with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
studio: {studio_name}
stages: [{stage_list}]              # [] for continuous
active_stage: {first_stage}         # "" for continuous
mode: {continuous|discrete|hybrid}
continuous_from: {stage_name}       # only present for hybrid mode
status: active
created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
---
```

Include the user's intent description as the markdown body:

```markdown
# {Intent Title}

## Problem

{User's description of what they want to accomplish}

## Solution

{To be defined during the plan phase}

## Success Criteria

{To be defined during the plan phase}
```

### Step 7: Create Workspace

Create the directory structure:
```
.haiku/intents/{slug}/
  intent.md
  knowledge/
  stages/
  state/
```

### Step 8: Persistence Setup

```bash
# Persistence is automatic — git add + commit the intent directory
git add ".haiku/intents/{slug}/"
git commit -m "haiku: new intent — {slug}"
```

### Step 9: Present Intent for Review

Before starting execution, the agent **MUST** present the intent for high-level direction review using `ask_user_visual_question`. The context **MUST** include:
- Intent title and description
- Selected studio and its stage pipeline
- Selected mode (continuous/discrete/hybrid)
- Any skip_stages or follows relationships

The question **MUST** ask: "Does this direction look right? Ready to start?"

The agent **MUST NOT** transition to `/haiku:resume` without the user's explicit approval of the high-level direction.

### Step 10: Start Execution

**Continuous mode:** After user approval, invoke `/haiku:resume` via the `Skill` tool.

**Discrete mode:** After user approval, tell the user to run `/haiku:resume` to start the first stage.

## Autonomous Mode (for /haiku:autopilot)

When called from autopilot, the following adjustments apply:
- The agent **MUST** skip the mode question — use `continuous`
- The agent **MUST** skip confirmation prompts — proceed automatically
- Studio recommendation still runs (Step 3b), but the agent **MUST** auto-select the best match — the agent **MUST NOT** ask in autopilot mode
- The intent description is provided as the argument (**REQUIRED**)
- The agent **MUST NOT** invoke `/haiku:resume` at the end — autopilot handles the transition

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| No git repo | Error: "Must be in a git repository" |
| Cowork mode | Error: "Cannot run in cowork mode" |
| Active intent exists | Warn, ask to confirm or resume |
| Invalid studio | Fall back to ideation, warn user |
| Branch already exists | Checkout existing branch, warn user |
