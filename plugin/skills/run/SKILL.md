# H·AI·K·U Run

## Name

`haiku:run` - Advance an H·AI·K·U intent through its stages.

## Synopsis

```
/haiku:run [intent-slug]
```

## Description

**User-facing command** — Drives an intent through the studio's stage sequence. The MCP orchestrator (`haiku_run_next`) tells you what to do at each step. You execute, then ask again. Repeat until the intent completes.

## Pre-checks

1. **Reject cowork mode:** The agent **MUST NOT** run this skill in cowork mode. If `CLAUDE_CODE_IS_COWORK=1`, the agent **MUST** stop with an error.
2. **Context window preflight:** The agent **MUST** verify sufficient context for meaningful work.

## Implementation

### The Loop

The entire execution model is a loop:

```
1. Call haiku_run_next { intent: slug }
2. Read the returned action
3. Execute the action
4. Repeat from step 1
```

The orchestrator handles ALL state logic — which stage is active, which phase it's in, which unit is ready, whether the gate passed. The agent **MUST** follow the action returned by the orchestrator and **MUST NOT** attempt to manage state independently.

### Resolving the Intent

If a slug was provided as an argument, use it. Otherwise:

```
haiku_intent_list → find the active intent
```

If no active intent: error, suggest `/haiku:new`.

### Action Reference

The orchestrator returns one of these actions. Follow the instructions for each:

#### `start_stage`

A new stage is beginning. The orchestrator provides the stage name and hat list.

```json
{ "action": "start_stage", "intent": "...", "studio": "...", "stage": "...", "hats": [...], "follows": "parent-slug", "parent_knowledge": ["DISCOVERY.md", ...] }
```

**Do:**
1. `haiku_stage_start { intent, stage }` — marks the stage as active
2. If `follows` is present (this intent iterates on a previous one), load the parent intent's knowledge artifacts via `haiku_knowledge_read { intent: follows, name: ... }` for each file in `parent_knowledge`. Copy relevant knowledge to this intent's knowledge directory as a starting point.
3. Call `haiku_run_next` again — it will return the elaboration action (`decompose`)

#### `decompose`

Elaborate on the stage: research the problem space, produce knowledge artifacts, then break the stage's work into units.

```json
{ "action": "decompose", "intent": "...", "studio": "...", "stage": "..." }
```

**Do:**
1. Read the stage's STAGE.md for inputs, unit types, and criteria guidance
2. Read the stage's `discovery/` definitions (in the studio directory: `stages/{stage}/discovery/*.md`) to understand what knowledge artifacts this stage must produce
3. Load resolved input artifacts from upstream stages — each discovery definition specifies a `location:` field indicating where the artifact lives (`.haiku/knowledge/` for project-wide, `.haiku/intents/{slug}/knowledge/` for intent-specific). Check freshness metadata — if inputs are stale or code has drifted, use `/haiku:refine stage:{upstream}` for a scoped side-trip
4. **Research and write discovery artifacts** to their specified locations. These are knowledge artifacts — analysis, inventories, specs, threat models — that capture what you learned about the problem space. Write each artifact to the `location:` specified in its discovery definition
5. Elaborate the work into units with completion criteria and a dependency DAG
7. For each unit, populate `refs:` in frontmatter — an array of paths to upstream artifacts relevant to that unit.
8. Write unit files to `.haiku/intents/{slug}/stages/{stage}/units/`
9. **ELABORATE COLLABORATIVELY.** Elaboration is a **multi-turn conversation** between the agent and the user. The agent **MUST NOT** treat elaboration as a single pass where it researches, writes units, and presents a finished plan. Instead:

   - The agent **MUST** engage the user iteratively — ask questions, get answers, refine, ask more questions
   - The agent **MUST** ask about architecture preferences, constraints, priorities, unknowns
   - The agent **MUST** probe for edge cases and non-obvious requirements
   - The agent **MUST** validate assumptions with the user before writing them into units
   - The agent **MUST** present options and tradeoffs when decisions are needed
   - The agent **MUST NOT** silently make design decisions — if there's a choice, present it to the user
   - The agent **SHALL** continue the conversation until both the agent and user are confident the plan is solid
   
   **Simple questions** → the agent **MUST** ask in the terminal as natural conversation.
   **Rich content** (wireframes, diagrams, multi-option comparisons, design directions, formatted specs) → the agent **MUST** use `ask_user_visual_question`. The visual tool renders markdown, supports images, and provides structured input. Any time the agent is presenting something the user needs to SEE to evaluate, the visual tool is **REQUIRED**.
   
10. **PRESENT THE FINAL PLAN for approval using a visual review tool.** Once units are written, the agent **MUST** call `open_review { intent_dir, review_type: "intent" }` in a **background subagent** to present the complete plan visually. The tool blocks until the user submits their decision. The agent **MUST** run it in a subagent so the main conversation remains responsive:
    ```
    Agent { prompt: "Call open_review for intent ..., wait for decision, return result", run_in_background: true }
    ```
    Tell the user the review is open and wait for the subagent to return.
11. After user approval: `haiku_stage_set { intent, stage, field: "phase", value: "execute" }`
12. Call `haiku_run_next` again

## Visual Review Requirements (RFC 2119)

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "REQUIRED" in this section are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. The agent **MUST** use `open_review` to present elaboration plans. Presenting unit lists, criteria, or stage summaries as plain conversation text is a **violation**.
2. The agent **MUST** run `open_review` in a **background subagent** (`run_in_background: true`). The tool blocks — running it in the foreground freezes the conversation.
3. The agent **MUST** use `ask_user_visual_question` for any elaboration question involving rich content (specs, wireframes, multi-option comparisons, formatted tables). Simple yes/no clarifications MAY use the terminal.
4. The agent **MUST** use `pick_design_direction` when presenting design alternatives.
5. The agent **MUST NOT** present plans, reviews, specs, or structured data as plain conversation text when a visual MCP tool exists for that content type.
6. The agent **SHALL** verify that the visual review tool was invoked before advancing the phase. If `open_review` was not called, the agent **MUST** call it before setting `phase: "execute"`.
7. Gate reviews **MUST** use `open_review`. The orchestrator auto-opens it on `gate_ask`. If the response lacks `review_url`, the agent **MUST** call it explicitly in a background subagent.

**Discovery vs. Output artifacts:** Stages define two artifact directories:
- `stages/{stage}/discovery/` — knowledge artifacts produced during elaboration (research, analysis, specs)
- `stages/{stage}/outputs/` — work products produced during execute (code, configs, deliverables)

#### `start_units` (parallel)

Multiple units are ready with no blocking dependencies. Execute them in parallel using agent teams.

```json
{ "action": "start_units", "intent": "...", "stage": "...", "units": ["unit-01", "unit-02", ...], "first_hat": "...", "hats": [...] }
```

**Do:**
1. For each unit in `units`, spawn an Agent (subagent) using the Agent tool:
   - Set `isolation: "worktree"` so each agent works on an isolated copy of the repo
   - The prompt should include: intent slug, stage, unit name, hat, the unit's refs, and the stage's artifact definitions
   - Each agent runs the full hat sequence for its unit autonomously (start → hats → complete)
   - `haiku_unit_start { intent, stage, unit, hat: first_hat }` at the beginning
   - `haiku_unit_complete { intent, stage, unit }` when criteria are met
2. The agent **MUST** launch all agents in a single message (parallel tool calls) — the agent **MUST NOT** run them sequentially
3. Wait for all agents to complete
4. Call `haiku_run_next` again — it will return the next batch of ready units or advance the phase

**Each agent's prompt should include:**
- The hat definition from `stages/{stage}/hats/{hat}.md`
- The unit's content and completion criteria
- The unit's `refs:` artifacts
- Instruction to work ONLY on this unit's scope — the agent **MUST NOT** modify files outside the unit's responsibility
- The H·AI·K·U MCP tools needed: `haiku_unit_start`, `haiku_unit_advance_hat`, `haiku_unit_complete`, `haiku_unit_increment_bolt`

#### `start_unit`

A single unit is ready (no other units can run in parallel). Execute it directly.

```json
{ "action": "start_unit", "intent": "...", "stage": "...", "unit": "...", "first_hat": "...", "hats": [...] }
```

**Do:**
1. `haiku_unit_start { intent, stage, unit, hat: first_hat }`
2. Load the hat definition from `stages/{stage}/hats/{hat}.md`
3. Load the unit's `refs:` from frontmatter — read each referenced artifact. These are the upstream designs, specs, and knowledge docs that inform this unit's work. For image/binary refs, note their existence and what they represent (from the design brief). For text refs, read and use their content.
4. Load the stage's artifact definitions — `discovery/*.md` and `outputs/*.md`
5. Execute the hat's work using the referenced artifacts as source material. The implementation should match what the design mockups show, satisfy the behavioral specs, and follow the architectural patterns from discovery.
6. Call `haiku_run_next` again

#### `continue_unit`

An active unit — resume where you left off.

```json
{ "action": "continue_unit", "intent": "...", "stage": "...", "unit": "...", "hat": "...", "bolt": N, "hats": [...] }
```

**Do:**
1. Load the current hat definition
2. Load the unit's `refs:` — the upstream artifacts that inform this unit (same as start_unit step 3)
3. Continue the hat's work using the referenced artifacts — write outputs to the locations specified in the stage's artifact definitions
3. When the hat's work is done, advance to the next hat:
   `haiku_unit_advance_hat { intent, stage, unit, hat: next_hat }`
4. After all hats complete, check unit completion criteria
5. If criteria met: `haiku_unit_complete { intent, stage, unit }`
6. If not met: `haiku_unit_increment_bolt { intent, stage, unit }` — starts a new bolt cycle
7. Call `haiku_run_next` again

**CRITICAL: The agent **MUST NOT** ask questions during execution.** The bolt loop is fully autonomous. If the agent encounters ambiguity, the agent **MUST** make a reasonable decision. The agent **MUST** document assumptions in the unit's `## Notes` section.

#### `advance_phase`

The orchestrator is moving to the next phase within a stage.

```json
{ "action": "advance_phase", "intent": "...", "stage": "...", "from_phase": "...", "to_phase": "..." }
```

**Do:**
1. `haiku_stage_set { intent, stage, field: "phase", value: to_phase }`
2. Call `haiku_run_next` again

#### `review`

Run adversarial review agents for the stage.

```json
{ "action": "review", "intent": "...", "studio": "...", "stage": "..." }
```

**Do:**
1. Load review agents from `stages/{stage}/review-agents/` (own agents)
2. Load included agents from `review-agents-include` in the stage's STAGE.md
3. Spawn one subagent per review agent, in parallel — each gets the mandate, the diff, and the stage outputs
4. Collect findings. If HIGH severity findings: fix them, then repeat review (up to 3 cycles)
5. `haiku_stage_set { intent, stage, field: "phase", value: "gate" }`
6. `haiku_stage_set { intent, stage, field: "gate_entered_at", value: NOW }`
7. Call `haiku_run_next` again

Note: Artifacts are persisted (committed to git) automatically during execution — `haiku_unit_start`, `haiku_unit_complete`, `haiku_stage_start`, and `haiku_stage_complete` all auto-commit. There is no separate "persist" step.

#### `gate_ask`

The stage's review gate requires human approval.

```json
{ "action": "gate_ask", "intent": "...", "stage": "...", "next_stage": "..." }
```

**The visual review **MUST** open.** When `haiku_run_next` returns `gate_ask`, the agent **MUST** call `open_review` in a **background subagent** (the tool blocks until the user submits). If `haiku_run_next` auto-opened it (check for `review_url` in the response), the subagent **MUST** call `get_review_status` to wait for the decision instead.

**Do:**
1. Spawn a background subagent that calls `open_review { intent_dir, review_type: "intent" }` and waits for the user's decision. Tell the user the review is open.
2. If approved: `haiku_gate_approve { intent, stage }` then call `haiku_run_next`
3. If `changes_requested`: analyze the annotations to determine which stage needs the fix:
   - Read each annotation's `location` field (file path or section name)
   - Comments on design artifacts (e.g., `stages/design/artifacts/...`, `DESIGN-BRIEF.md`) → `/haiku:refine stage:design`
   - Comments on behavioral specs (`BEHAVIORAL-SPEC.md`, `DATA-CONTRACTS.md`) → `/haiku:refine stage:product`
   - Comments on discovery/architecture docs → `/haiku:refine stage:inception`
   - Comments on code or implementation → fix in the current stage (create a new unit or increment bolt)
   - If multiple stages are implicated, start with the most upstream one
   - If unclear, ask the user which stage to revisit
   - After the refine side-trip completes, return to the current gate and call `haiku_run_next` again

#### `gate_external`

Push for external review.

```json
{ "action": "gate_external", "intent": "...", "stage": "...", "next_stage": "..." }
```

**Do:**
1. Push the branch and commit stage artifacts
2. Generate the browse URL: `https://{site}/browse/{host}/{project}/intent/{slug}/{stage}/`
3. Share the URL with the reviewer (via comms provider if configured, otherwise output to terminal)
4. The reviewer opens the browse page, reviews the artifacts, and clicks "Approve Stage"
5. The approval writes directly to the repo via git API
6. `/haiku:triggers` picks up the approval on next poll and advances the gate
7. `haiku_stage_complete { intent, stage, gate_outcome: "blocked" }` — blocks until approval

#### `gate_await`

Waiting for an external event.

```json
{ "action": "gate_await", "intent": "...", "stage": "...", "next_stage": "..." }
```

**Do:**
1. Report what is being awaited
2. `haiku_stage_complete { intent, stage, gate_outcome: "awaiting" }`
3. Stop. The user runs `/haiku:run` when the event occurs.

#### `advance_stage`

Gate passed — moving to the next stage (continuous mode).

```json
{ "action": "advance_stage", "intent": "...", "stage": "...", "next_stage": "...", "gate_outcome": "advanced" }
```

**Do:**
1. `haiku_stage_complete { intent, stage, gate_outcome: "advanced" }`
2. `haiku_intent_set { slug, field: "active_stage", value: next_stage }`
3. Commit stage artifacts
4. Call `haiku_run_next` again — it will return `start_stage` for the next stage

#### `stage_complete_discrete`

Stage done but discrete mode — stop and wait for user.

```json
{ "action": "stage_complete_discrete", "intent": "...", "stage": "...", "next_stage": "..." }
```

**Do:**
1. `haiku_stage_complete { intent, stage, gate_outcome: "advanced" }`
2. `haiku_intent_set { slug, field: "active_stage", value: next_stage }`
3. Report: "Stage complete. Run `/haiku:run` for the next stage."

#### `intent_complete`

All stages are done.

```json
{ "action": "intent_complete", "intent": "...", "studio": "..." }
```

**Do:**
1. `haiku_intent_set { slug, field: "status", value: "completed" }`
2. `haiku_intent_set { slug, field: "completed_at", value: NOW }`
3. Report completion summary. Suggest `/haiku:review` then PR creation.

#### `blocked`

Units are blocked on dependencies or need intervention.

```json
{ "action": "blocked", "intent": "...", "stage": "...", "blocked_units": [...] }
```

**Do:**
1. Report which units are blocked and why
2. Ask the user for guidance

#### `composite_run_stage`

For composite intents — a specific studio:stage is ready.

```json
{ "action": "composite_run_stage", "intent": "...", "studio": "...", "stage": "...", "hats": [...] }
```

**Do:** Same as `start_stage`, but for a composite intent. The orchestrator handles sync points.

#### `error`

Something is wrong.

```json
{ "action": "error", "message": "..." }
```

**Do:** Report the error to the user.

## Relationship to Other Skills

- **`/haiku:composite`** — Creates composite intents with sync points
- **`/haiku:refine`** — Amend specs mid-execution or refine upstream stages
- **`/haiku:review`** — Pre-delivery code review
- **`/haiku:reflect`** — Post-completion analysis
