# H·AI·K·U Guide

H·AI·K·U = Human + AI Knowledge Unification. A lifecycle framework for structured AI-assisted work.

## How It Works

All commands are MCP prompts on the `haiku` server. Invoke them as `/haiku:new`, `/haiku:resume`, etc. Do NOT use the Skill tool for haiku commands — they are MCP prompts, not skills.

The orchestrator tool `haiku_run_next { intent }` drives everything. It returns an action + `stage_metadata`. Follow the action, then call it again. Repeat.

## Hierarchy

**Studio** → **Stage** → **Unit** → **Bolt**

- **Studio** — lifecycle template (e.g., software, ideation). Defines stages.
- **Stage** — phase within a studio (e.g., inception, design, development). Has hats, review gates, unit types.
- **Unit** — discrete piece of work within a stage. Has completion criteria and a dependency DAG.
- **Bolt** — iteration cycle within a unit. Increment when criteria aren't met.
- **Hat** — behavioral role scoped to a stage (e.g., architect, builder, reviewer).

## Stage Scope (Critical)

Every `haiku_run_next` response includes `stage_metadata` — the stage's description, allowed unit_types, and STAGE.md body. ALL work MUST stay within the stage's scope. Do not produce outputs belonging to other stages.

## Phase Distinction (Critical)

**Elaborate** and **Execute** are fundamentally different:

- **Elaborate** = broad research + unit definition. No hat rotation. Produce discovery artifacts (knowledge/) and unit specs (scope, criteria, dependencies). Do NOT produce the actual deliverables — units are instructions for focused work, not the work itself. One adversarial review before the human gate.

- **Execute** = focused work through hats. Each unit runs through the stage's hat sequence (e.g., architect → builder → reviewer). Each hat is a separate subagent. Hats ensure completeness via different perspectives. This is where deliverables are produced and written to `stages/{stage}/artifacts/`.

Elaboration produces the PLAN. Execution produces the WORK.

## Key MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `haiku_run_next` | FSM driver — reads state, performs mutation, returns next action |
| `haiku_go_back` | Go back to a previous stage or phase (human-initiated) |
| `haiku_intent_list` | List all intents |
| `haiku_intent_get` | Read an intent field |
| `haiku_stage_get` | Read a stage field |
| `haiku_unit_start` | Start a unit |
| `haiku_unit_advance_hat` | Move to next hat |
| `haiku_unit_complete` | Complete a unit |
| `haiku_unit_increment_bolt` | New iteration cycle |
| `ask_user_visual_question` | Open question form (blocks until user responds) |
| `pick_design_direction` | Open design direction picker |
| `haiku_studio_list` | List available studios |

Review gates are handled automatically by `haiku_run_next` — it opens the review UI, blocks until the user decides, and returns the outcome. Do NOT call `open_review` directly.
