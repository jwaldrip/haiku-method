# Evaluate

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Tradeoff analysis scores each option against weighted criteria with explicit reasoning for each score"
- "Scenario modeling tests each option under at least 3 market conditions (bull, base, bear) with quantified outcomes"
- "Risk analysis identifies the top 3 risks per option with probability estimates and mitigation strategies"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Options are evaluated"
- "Tradeoffs are analyzed"
- "Risks are identified"

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

Evaluation report **MUST** exist with multi-criteria scoring, scenario analysis results, and risk assessment for each option. Evaluator **MUST** have confirmed the evaluation framework is consistent and comprehensive. Risk-analyst **MUST** have validated probability estimates and stress-tested key assumptions.
