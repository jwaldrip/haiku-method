# Inception

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Discovery document maps all entities with their fields and relationships"
- "Each unit has 3-5 completion criteria, each verifiable by a specific command or test"
- "Unit DAG has no circular dependencies — verified by topological sort"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Domain is understood"
- "Units have criteria"
- "Elaboration is complete"

## Overlap Awareness

During elaboration, check for other active H·AI·K·U branches working on overlapping files:

```bash
# List active haiku branches and their changed files
for branch in $(git branch -r --list 'origin/haiku/*/main' 2>/dev/null); do
  changed=$(git diff --name-only main...$branch 2>/dev/null)
  [ -n "$changed" ] && echo "Branch: $branch" && echo "$changed"
done
```

If overlap is detected with files this intent plans to modify, note it in the discovery document. Not a blocker — just awareness for the architect hat to factor in.

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

Discovery document **MUST** exist with domain model and technical landscape. All units **MUST** have specs with dependencies and verifiable completion criteria. Unit DAG **MUST** be acyclic. Each unit **MUST** be scoped to complete within a single bolt.
