# Design

## Elaboration Phase

During elaboration, create **low-fidelity wireframes** to establish layout, flow, and interaction patterns. Use HTML wireframes or a design provider MCP (Pencil, OpenPencil, Figma). NEVER produce ASCII art. Save wireframes to `stages/design/artifacts/`. Use `pick_design_direction` or `ask_user_visual_question` to present options and get user feedback before finalizing the elaboration.

## Execute Phase

During execute, the designer hat produces **high-fidelity mockups** from the approved wireframes. Apply real design tokens, specify all interactive states, define responsive behavior at each breakpoint. The output is production-ready design — polished, not sketched.

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Screen layouts specified for mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1280px) breakpoints"
- "All interactive elements have specified states: default, hover, focus, active, disabled, error"
- "Design uses only named tokens from the design system — no raw hex values"
- "Touch targets are at least 44px on mobile"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Responsive design done"
- "States are defined"
- "Colors are consistent"

## Completion Signal

Design brief exists with screen layouts for all breakpoints. All interactive states are specified. Touch targets meet minimum size. Design tokens are defined (no raw hex values). Design reviewer has verified consistency, state coverage, and accessibility compliance.
