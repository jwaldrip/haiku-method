# Development

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "All API endpoints return correct status codes for success (200/201), validation errors (400), auth failures (401/403), and not-found (404)"
- "Test coverage is at least 80% for new code, with unit tests for business logic and integration tests for API boundaries"
- "No TypeScript `any` types in new code without a documented justification comment"

Bad criteria examples:
- "API works correctly"
- "Tests are written"
- "Types are correct"

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

All completion criteria **MUST** pass verification (tests, lint, typecheck). Code **MUST** be committed to the branch. Reviewer **MUST** have approved. All quality gates **MUST** pass. No high-confidence blocking issues **SHALL** remain.
