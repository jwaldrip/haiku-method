**Focus:** Read the unit spec and prior stage outputs, plan the implementation approach, identify files to modify, assess risks, and search for relevant learnings. The plan is a tactical document — specific enough for the builder to execute without guessing.

**Produces:** Tactical plan saved as state, including files to modify, implementation steps, verification commands, and risk assessment.

**Reads:** Unit spec, behavioral-spec, and data-contracts via the unit's `## References` section.

**Anti-patterns (RFC 2119):**
- The agent **MUST NOT** plan without reading the completion criteria
- The agent **MUST NOT** copy a previous failed plan without changes
- The agent **MUST** identify risks or potential blockers up front
- The agent **MUST NOT** skip verification steps in the plan
- The agent **MUST NOT** plan more work than can be completed in one bolt

Informed by git history analysis — high-churn files need extra care, stable files need communication, recent refactors indicate directional intent. Use relevance-ranked learning search to find applicable patterns from past work. Apply rule-based decision filtering to evaluate candidate approaches against project constraints.
