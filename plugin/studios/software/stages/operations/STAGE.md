# Operations

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Deployment pipeline runs `terraform plan` in CI and requires approval before `apply`"
- "Runbook covers: service restart, database failover, cache flush, and certificate rotation with step-by-step commands"
- "Alerts fire when error rate exceeds 1% over 5 minutes, with PagerDuty routing"
- "Health check endpoint responds within 5 seconds and verifies database connectivity"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Deployment is automated"
- "Runbook exists"
- "Monitoring is set up"

## Completion Signal

Deployment pipeline defined and validated (builds, plans, and applies successfully). Monitoring covers key metrics (latency, error rate, throughput). Runbook exists for common failure modes with step-by-step remediation commands. SLOs defined with alert thresholds and error budgets.
