# Security

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "OWASP Top 10 coverage verified: each category has at least one test or documented N/A justification"
- "All SQL queries use parameterized statements — verified by grep for string concatenation in query construction"
- "Authentication tokens expire after 1 hour and refresh tokens after 30 days, verified by test"
- "All user input is validated at the API boundary before reaching business logic"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Security review done"
- "No SQL injection"
- "Auth is secure"

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

All identified threats **MUST** have documented mitigations. Security tests **MUST** cover the attack surface. No critical or high findings **SHALL** remain unaddressed. OWASP Top 10 coverage **MUST** be verified with evidence. Security reviewer **MUST** have approved.
