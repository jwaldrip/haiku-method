# Publish

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "All internal and external links resolve to valid targets"
- "All critical and major review findings are addressed in the final version"
- "Documentation renders correctly in the target platform (site, wiki, PDF)"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Documentation is published"
- "Links work"
- "Formatting is done"

## Completion Signal

Final documentation exists with all review findings addressed. Links are validated. Formatting is correct for the target platform. Metadata (title, description, last-updated date) is populated. Documentation is published or staged for publication.
