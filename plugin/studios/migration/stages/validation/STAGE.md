# Validation

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Row-count reconciliation shows zero discrepancy between source and target for every entity"
- "Spot-check validation compares at least 100 randomly sampled records per entity with field-level diff"
- "Performance benchmarks show target query latency within 10% of source for critical paths"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Data looks correct"
- "Validation is complete"
- "Performance is acceptable"

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

Validation report **MUST** exist with quantitative reconciliation results (row counts, checksum comparisons, sample diffs). Functional parity tests confirm that downstream consumers produce identical results against the migrated data. Performance benchmarks are within defined thresholds.
