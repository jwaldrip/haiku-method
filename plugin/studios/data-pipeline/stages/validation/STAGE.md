# Validation

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Data quality checks cover uniqueness, not-null constraints, referential integrity, and accepted value ranges for every target table"
- "Row count reconciliation between source and target is within the agreed tolerance (e.g., < 0.1% variance)"
- "Business rule tests verify at least 3 known edge cases per critical transformation (e.g., timezone handling, currency conversion, null propagation)"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Data quality is validated"
- "Tests pass"
- "Business rules are checked"

## Completion Signal

Validation suite covers schema compliance, uniqueness, referential integrity, accepted value ranges, and row count reconciliation. Business rule tests verify edge cases. Data quality reviewer has confirmed test coverage is sufficient and all critical paths have assertions. Validation results are logged with pass/fail/warning status per check.
