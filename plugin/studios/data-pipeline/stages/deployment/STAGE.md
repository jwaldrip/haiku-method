# Deployment

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Pipeline DAG is registered in the orchestrator with correct dependencies, retry policies, and SLA-based alerting"
- "Monitoring covers pipeline runtime, row counts per stage, data freshness, and error rates with alerts routed to the on-call channel"
- "Runbook documents manual recovery steps for the 3 most likely failure modes (source unavailable, schema drift, transformation timeout)"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Pipeline is deployed"
- "Monitoring is set up"
- "Documentation exists"

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

Pipeline is deployed to the production orchestrator with correct scheduling, dependencies, and retry policies. Monitoring dashboards show pipeline health, data freshness, and row count trends. Alerting is configured for SLA breaches and pipeline failures. Runbook **MUST** exist with recovery procedures for common failure scenarios. SRE **MUST** have **MUST** be verified the deployment meets operational readiness criteria.
