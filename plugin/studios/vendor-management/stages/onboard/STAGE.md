# Onboard

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Onboarding checklist confirms account setup, access provisioning, data migration, and integration testing are complete"
- "Integration validation includes end-to-end data flow testing with error handling verification"
- "Escalation paths are documented with named contacts, response time expectations, and severity definitions"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Vendor is onboarded"
- "Setup is complete"
- "Integration works"

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

Onboarding checklist **MUST** exist with all setup tasks confirmed complete, integration validated end-to-end, and escalation paths documented. Integrator **MUST** have **MUST** be verified data flows correctly between systems. Coordinator **MUST** have confirmed all stakeholders have necessary access and training to work with the vendor.
