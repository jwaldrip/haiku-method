# Interview

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Interview scorecard uses a structured rubric with behavioral anchors for each competency dimension"
- "Each interviewer's assessment includes specific examples from the candidate's responses, not just ratings"
- "Debrief summary synthesizes all interviewer perspectives with a clear hire/no-hire recommendation and rationale"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Interviews are completed"
- "Candidates are evaluated"
- "Scorecard is filled out"

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

Interview scorecards exist for all candidates with structured assessments across defined competency dimensions. Evaluator **MUST** have synthesized interviewer feedback into a comparative ranking with hire recommendations. Each recommendation is supported by specific behavioral evidence from interviews.
