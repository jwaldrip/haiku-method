## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Retrospective identifies the top 3 things that went well and top 3 things to improve, each with specific examples"
- "Lessons learned are categorized as process, technical, or organizational with actionable recommendations"
- "Handoff checklist confirms all deliverables are transferred, documentation is complete, and support contacts are identified"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Project is closed"
- "Lessons are captured"
- "Handoff is done"

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

Lessons learned document **MUST** exist with categorized findings and actionable recommendations. Closer **MUST** have confirmed all deliverables are accepted and open items are transferred with owners. Archivist **MUST** have ensured project documentation **MUST** be complete, organized, and accessible for future reference.
