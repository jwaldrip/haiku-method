# Proposal

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Proposal maps each prospect pain point to a specific solution capability with expected impact"
- "Business case includes quantified ROI with stated assumptions and a sensitivity analysis"
- "Demo script addresses the top 3 prospect priorities identified in the deal brief"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Proposal is written"
- "Business case looks compelling"
- "Demo is ready"

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

Proposal document **MUST** exist with solution tailored to the prospect's specific pain points, business case with quantified ROI, and implementation approach. Solution architect **MUST** have validated technical feasibility and mapped the solution to the prospect's environment. All deliverables are ready for prospect presentation.
