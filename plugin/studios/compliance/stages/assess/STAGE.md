# Assess

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "Gap analysis evaluates every in-scope control with current implementation status (met/partial/unmet) and supporting evidence"
- "Risk assessment assigns likelihood and impact scores to each gap using a consistent methodology"
- "Assessment documents the specific evidence reviewed for each control determination"

Bad criteria examples:
- "Gaps are identified"
- "Risks are assessed"
- "Assessment is thorough"

## Completion Signal (RFC 2119)

Gap report **MUST** exist covering every in-scope control with a determination (met, partially met, or unmet) backed by specific evidence. Risk assessment ranks all gaps by severity using consistent scoring. Each gap **MUST** have a clear description of what is missing and what would constitute remediation. No controls are left unassessed.
